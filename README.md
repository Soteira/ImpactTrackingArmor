# ImpactTrackingArmor

Concept

  As the name suggests this project aims to build an armor pieces with sensors that will register hits.  Those hits will set off other effects such as turning on a light in a particular color and registering the hit count on a small screen.  This will provide a useful way to track the total count of hits and also signal to the rest of the room when a hit has been struck.  In this way it will serve a similar purpose to the existing system used for detecting hits in professional fencing but it will be much cooler.  

  To achieve this goal there are several elements and we will start with the armor proper.  The armor will be based on the female fantasy armor pattern from Prince Armory.  There will certainly be various modifications for both form and function purposes but the basic pattern will remain.  To get it to the desired size for use the armor pattern will be increased at all points by 15 percent.  This will give the rough measurements of 40.25 inches for the chest, 32.2 inches for the waist, and 41.4 inches for the hip.  These measurements will change somewhat due to minor errors in the handmaking process.  It is also worth noting that while this is the default size the straps can increase or decrease this in practice.  
  The leather used will be 8 ounce C-grade cowhide processed via vegetable tanning methods.  This provides a solid surface not only for striking and for use as armor but also as a building surface for electronics and hardware elements.  The pieces will cut using the paper printed patterns previously mentioned.  Once hand cut the pieces will be laser etched/burned using the FUSE makerspace laser cutting machines on a low setting.  After the laser effects are complete the pieces will be painted and shaped.  Finally they will be riveted together using double sided quick rivets of medium size.  Final fitting wll be competed with straps added as needed for comfort and function.  After curing for a day it will be ready to take on other elements.

  The first and most important sensor system will be the piezoelectric sensors.  These are the most vital as every other effect flows from the information that they gather.  The basic idea is to place a handful of such sensors into the armor at key points.  They will be placed in such a way that normal movement within the armor will not cause them to compress or detect a hit.
